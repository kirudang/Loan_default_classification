# Loan_default_classification
**Objective**:The aim of this article is to demonstrate effective strategies for handling imbalanced class data. Multiple techniques will be discussed, including data resampling through oversampling and undersampling, the use of advanced models such as weighted logistic regression and decision tree with loss matrix, as well as the Balanced Random Forest model with Feature Selection. Additionally, threshold adjustment and hyperparameter tuning will be explored, along with the potential use of domain knowledge to guide the decision-making process.

**Use case**: Classify if bank customers are default or non-default from a highly imbalanced dataset.
